In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.  When the game gegins, a fleaet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens,. ifthe player shoots all the aliens, a new fleed appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

Extras I would like to implement.
    - explosion with bullet collision
    - bullets coming from the aliens
    - sound effects from shooting and explosions
    - different style where aliens move toward you not crawling down the screen
